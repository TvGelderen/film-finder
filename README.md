#FilmFinder

This is a web app for searching and saving movies. The frontend uses Nuxt and uses the API from The Movie Database (www.themoviedb.org) to fetch the movie data. A seperate backend has been written in Go to handle the user management and authentication, user data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.
